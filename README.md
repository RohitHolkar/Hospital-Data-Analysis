Hospital Data Analysis using Power BI

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I utilized Power BI to analyze hospital data efficiently and create meaningful insights. This project focuses on understanding patient distribution, specialty-wise analysis, and trends over multiple years. Below are the highlights of my work:

Project Overview
Objective: To analyze and visualize patient data across various specialties and time periods, providing actionable insights to healthcare providers.
Tools Used: Power BI for visualization and analysis.
Key Insights
Specialty-Wise Analysis:

Orthopedics topped the chart with the highest patient count, followed by Otolaryngology (ENT) and Ophthalmology.
A clear visualization of patient volumes by specialty allows for better resource allocation.
Yearly Patient Trends:

The dataset shows a steady increase in total patients from 2018 to 2020, with a dip in 2021.
Month-wise analysis for Cardiology reveals consistent patient flow throughout the year.
Case Type and Age Profile:

Patients were categorized into Inpatient, Outpatient, and Day Case, providing clarity on hospital operations.
Age distribution shows significant patient counts in the 16â€“64 category for most specialties.
Interactive Dashboard Features
Filters for Specialty, Age Group, and Case Type to drill down data.
Time-based analysis for identifying seasonal trends.
Clean and interactive visuals, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, making data interpretation seamless.
Skills Developed
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Prepared raw data for analysis.
Visualization Techniques: Designed impactful visuals that highlight key metrics.
Power BI Features: Leveraged slicers, drill-throughs, and interactive filtering for an enhanced user experience.
